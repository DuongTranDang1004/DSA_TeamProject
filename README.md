Implementation Requirements 
You must create a class RMIT_Sudoku_Solver with the following method: 
public class RMIT_Sudoku_Solver { 
 public int[][] solve(int[][] puzzle) { 
 // Implement your solution here 
 } 
}
The method solve(int[][] puzzle): 
• Accepts a 2D integer array (9x9) representing the Sudoku puzzle. 
• Each cell contains an integer from 0 to 9: 
o 1-9 => Pre-filled numbers (must remain unchanged in the solution) 
o 0 => Empty cells that your program must solve. 
• Returns a 9x9 2D array containing the solved Sudoku puzzle. 
• Each cell in the returned array must contain a value from 1 to 9. 
If your program cannot find a solution within 2 minutes (on any computer), it must raise an 
exception. 
You may create additional classes and methods needed to organize your code eectively. 
Each method require unit test.
